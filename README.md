# AI Models for Psychology: Dimensional Classification of Mental Disorders (HiTOP)

## üéØ Project Overview

This is an **interdisciplinary joint project** with students from Psychology at the **Hochschule Ravensburg-Weingarten (RWU)** and studends from Computer Science and IT Productmanagement at the **Hochschule Furtwangen**. The goal is to leverage Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence to address critical challenges in psychology.

The project focuses on developing two AI models based on an extensive database of approximately 10,000 rehabilitation patients from the RWU.


## üõ†Ô∏è Project Goals

1.  **HiTOP Classification Model:** Develop an AI model to identify the **higher-order dimensions** from the **Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology (HiTOP)** perspective. HiTOP is a framework that classifies mental disorders **dimensionally** instead of categorically.
2.  **Treatment Factor Model:** Develop a second AI model to identify **active factors** (Wirkfaktoren) in psychosomatic treatment.
